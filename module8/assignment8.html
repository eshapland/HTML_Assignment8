                <h4>El Castillo</h4>
                <p>Chichen Itza was one of the largest Maya cities and is considered to be one of the mythical great cities. El Castillo, also known 
                    as the Temple of Kukulcan, is a Mesoamercian step-pyramid in the heart of Chichen Itza. This incredible structure was built by the 
                    pre-colombian Maya civilization sometime between the 9th and 12th centuries CE. There are four staircases, each with 365 steps 
                (one for each day of the year) leading up to the summet temple.</p>

                <h4>Il Kil</h4>
                <p>The Riviera Maya has some of the greatest cenotes in the world. A cenote is a large sink holes with exposed groundwater underneath.
                They were sometimes used by the ancient Maya for sacrificial offerings. Today, cenotes are a marvel to see and many allow swimming, 
                snorkeling and cave diving. This cenote is called Il Kil and is one of the more lovely cenotes to visit.</p>

                <h4>Temple of a Thousand Warriors</h4>
                <p>Perhaps even more incredible to behold than El Castillo is the Temple of a Thousand Warriors. There are many amazing, ancient structure
                    in Chichen Itza, but this temple in the Northern part of the city was my favorite. The temple sits on top of a three-tiered pyramid and
                    there are some 200 squared columns surrounding the base of the temple. Each column showcases carvings that represent warriors of the 
                    Toltec civilization that once lived in the area.</p>
